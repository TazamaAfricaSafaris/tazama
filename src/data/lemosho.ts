        With the summit reaching 5,895 meters (19,341 feet) above sea level, the majestic Mount Kili-manjaro is the highest free-standing mountain in the world and Africa’s highest peak. To climb Kilimanjaro and watch the sunrise spread its golden light across the savannah below is an expe-rience and personal accomplishment second to none.

        Your first day on the mountain, Your guide will collect you from the hotel and drive to Londorossi Gate where we will register with the park, whilst our porters sort out the supplies and equipment for the trek. Next, we’ll be hiking through the forest along a lovely trail until we reach Mti Mkubwa (which means Big Tree) Camp, where you will spend the night.

        This will be a long hike but at a steady and gentle gradient. We’ll cross the high point over the Shi-ra Caldera and then descend to an off-the-beaten-path camp at Moir Hut. Moir Hut Camp offers an amazing view of Arrow Glacier and a welcome night’s sleep after a long trek. Shira is one of the highest plateaus on earth.

        Today,  you'll move from moorland to a semi-desert landscape. A 5-hour walk leads you to the Lava Tower (4630m). Lunch is served, and if weather permits, there's an option to climb the tower. Altitude effects like headaches may start. After lunch, a 6800m descent to Barranco Campsite (3950m) aids acclimatization. The camp, located beneath the Breach and Great Barranco Wall, offers drinking and washing water. Dinner is served as you witness the sunset.

        The fifth day on the mountain takes us to the top of the Great Barranco Wall for lunch before descending the scree to Karanga Valley Camp for the night. You won’t need poles to ascend the Wall, but you’ll want to keep your hands free. This part of the trek is a bit more work than it has been so far, but the view from atop the Wall (and another day of acclimatization to prepare us for the summit) is well worth it.

        Today is a brief hiking day. After an hour, you'll reach Barafu Hut, the last water stop for the porters as there is no accessible water at Barafu Camp (4550m). "Barafu" in Swahili means "ice," and this camp is situated on a rocky, exposed ridge. Tents will be exposed to wind and rocks, emphasizing the importance of hikers familiarizing themselves with the campsite before dark. An early dinner is provided to allow hikers to rest before the summit attempt later that night. Your guide will provide detailed instructions on preparing for summit night. It is advised to retire by 19:00 for a well-rested start.

        Summit Day! We’ll be up before midnight for a hot drink and a snack, and then up the mountain, we go! Our path will take us north-west from Barafu across heavy scree, then we’ll snake between Rebman and Ratzel Glaciers to reach Stella Point (5732 meters) just before dawn. We’ll take a breather at Stella Point, and see something few in the world ever will: sunrise at the top of Kilimanjaro! Next is the final ascent (in daylight) to Uhuru Peak itself, and the actual summit of Kilimanjaro. Finally, we’ll make our way to Mweka Camp, some 2700 meters below. The good news is it is much easier going down, and we’ll have a big dinner and our cozy sleeping bag and tent waiting for us for our last night on the mountain
