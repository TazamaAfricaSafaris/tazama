        "Our top recommendation. Remote and scenic, this trail passes through untouched rainforest and across the Shira Plateau before joining the western approach. It gives you plenty of time to acclimatize and is one of the most successful routes to the summit.",

      description:
        "The longest and most remote trail, circling around the mountain before reaching the summit. It offers excellent acclimatization and solitude but skips some iconic landmarks.",

        "The steepest and most direct route, suitable only for experienced trekkers. It is beautiful but demanding and not recommended for beginners.",
